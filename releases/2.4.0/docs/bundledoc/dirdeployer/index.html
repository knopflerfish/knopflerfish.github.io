      <h1 class="man">Directory deployer</h1>

<p>
Simple bundle which scans file system directories and
installs/uninstalls bundles found or removed from these directories.
</p>

<p>
This is a quite useful tool for handle bundle deployment without using any 
console. Just copy the bundles that should be started to the deploy 
directory, and the directory deployer will find and start them. When the 
files are removed, they are uninstalled.
</p>

<h2 class="man">Deploy method</h2>

<p>The procedure for scanning and deploying is as follows:

<ol>
<li>
Check if any new files have appeared or
if any already deployed files has been replaced with newer
files.
</li>

<li>
New files are installed into the framework.<br>
If they have a bundle activator, they are marked for delayed start.<br>
Files newer than a previously deployed bundle are updated.
</li>

<li>
Files that have the same location as an already installed
bundle is not installed again, instead, the installed bundle is
re-used in the created DeployedFile instance.
</li>

<li>Files marked for delayed start is started.
</li>

<li>Sleep a while</li>
<li>Repeat from 1.</li>

</ol>

<h2 class="man">Configuration</h2>

<p>
See <a href="https://www.knopflerfish.org/svn/knopflerfish.org/tags/2.4.0/osgi/bundles_opt/dirdeployer/resources/metatype.xml">metatype.xml</a> for
specification using CM. The same properties as defined by CM are also
read as default values from the system properties. Thus, the bundle
can be both configured by CM and using system properties.
</p>
<p>
Quick guide to the metatype.xml format:
<ul>
 <li>Top level <tt>xsd:complexType</tt> is service PIDs</li>
 <li><tt>xsd:element</tt> is a property</li>
 <li><tt>metatype:values</tt> defines default values</li>
</ul>
For details on the metatype format, see <a
href="http://www.knopflerfish.org/XMLMetatype">http://www.knopflerfish.org/XMLMetatype/</a>


<p> You can set the deployment directory in <tt>metatype.xml</tt> in
the bundle's resource directory (defaults to <tt>./load</tt>). The
path is relative to from where the framework is started (given that
the path is relative).  </p>

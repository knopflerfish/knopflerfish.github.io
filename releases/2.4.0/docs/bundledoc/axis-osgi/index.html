<div class="abstract">
This is an OSGi bundlification of a standard Axis server.
</div>

<p> The bundle is part of the <a href="../soap/index.html#axis1">The
Knopflerfish Axis 1</a> package.  </p>


<h2 class="man">Description</h2>

<p> The standard Axis server is designed to be running in a servlet
version 2.3 environment, while the OSGi HTTP service is based on a
servlet 2.1 environment. It should be noted that no modifications have
been made to any of the Axis classes, so all code specific to the OSGi
port is made as pure "extensions". In addition to the bundlification
of the Axis server the axis-osgi bundle offers the ability to export
services, registered on the OSGi framework service registry, as SOAP
services. It should be noted that for this to work the exported
objects must not expose any data types not supported by SOAP (as of
Knopflerfish 2.0.5 bean mappings are used for non-standard SOAP types
to relax this restriction). In order to export a service object as a
SOAP service, the only thing needed is to set a property named
"SOAP.service.name" on the registered service. As a convenience
<tt>org.knopflerfish.service.axis.AxisAdmin.SOAP_SERVICE_NAME</tt> is
a String constant that holds this name. The property value should be
of type java.lang.String and its value will be used as the name of the
exposed SOAP service.</p>

<p> The set of service methods exported from a service with the
<tt>SOAP.service.name</tt> property set can be controlled via another
service property named, <tt>SOAP.service.methods</tt>. If not set, or
set to the value <tt>*</tt> then <b>all</b> methods in the registered
classes are exposed as web service methods. If set to a string with
space separated method names, only those methods will be exposed as
web service methods. As a convenience
<tt>org.knopflerfish.service.axis.AxisAdmin.SOAP_SERVICE_METHODS</tt>
is a String constant that holds this service property name.  </p>

<p> The initial SOAP configuration of the Axis server is given by the
file "/axis/server-config.wsdd". In case you want to add some services
or for some other reason modify the initial configuration, this is
where to do it.</p>

<p> The code to make all this work consist of just a few quite small
classes (not counting all Axis classes) so it is quite easy to get an
overview of the porting effort. However it took some time
experimenting and studying the Axis code to make this work, so some of
the code may be harder to understand.</p>

<p> Note that the axis-osgi bundle depends on the commons-logging
bundle to be installed an started. Further if your JRE does not
support an XML parser you need to provide that as well (e.g Xerces).
</p>

<p> The axis-osgi.jar file is quite large, due to the contained
axis.jar (and other contained jars). Some of the Axis classes may be
left out, e.g. client related classes, in case you will not run any
Axis clients on your OSGi framework, WSDL related classes in case you
give up the ability for the server to generate WSDL for the SOAP
services. These kind of optimizations have not been performed, but is
probably possible to perform in case it becomes critical to reduce the
required memory footprint.  </p>

      <h1 class="man">kSOAP OSGi</h1>

<div class="abstract">
This is an OSGi bundlification of the lean kSOAP2 Java SOAP library.
</div>

<p> The bundle is part of the <a href="../soap/index.html#ksoap">The
Knopflerfish kSOAP</a> package.  </p>


<h2 class="man">Description</h2>

<p> The kSOAP OSGi bundle is bundle wrapper around the kSOAP 2 Java
SOAP library that provides a SOAP server that is much smaller than
those based on Axis 1 or Axis 2. The size of the kSOAP bundle is only
138&nbsp;kb. </p>

<p>The ksoap-osgi bundle offers the ability to export services,
registered on the OSGi framework service registry, as SOAP
services. It should be noted that for this to work the exported
objects must not expose any data types not supported by SOAP. In order
to export a service object as a SOAP service, the only thing needed is
to set a property named "SOAP.service.name" on the registered
service. As a convenience
<tt>org.knopflerfish.service.ksoap.KSoapAdmin.SOAP_SERVICE_NAME</tt> is a
String constant that holds this name. The property value should be of
type java.lang.String and its value will be used as the name of the
exposed SOAP service.</p>

<p> The set of service methods exported from a service with the
<tt>SOAP.service.name</tt> property set can be controlled via another
service property named, <tt>SOAP.service.methods</tt>. If not set, or
set to the value <tt>*</tt> then <b>all</b> methods in the registered
classes are exposed as web service methods. If set to a string with
space separated method names, only those methods will be exposed as
web service methods. As a convenience
<tt>org.knopflerfish.service.ksoap.KSoapAdmin.SOAP_SERVICE_METHODS</tt>
is a String constant that holds this service property name.  </p>

A SOAP service browser plug-in for the Desktop.

Knopflerfish Axis 1</a> package.  </p>


<h2 class="man">Description</h2>

<p>
This is a SOAP service browser written as a plug-in for the Swing Desktop.
When started, it adds a view that displays all available services
on a named SOAP host. The services can be browsed for operations and
the operations can be invoked. The SOAP host can be changed to view
services on another host.
</p>

<p>
The default SOAP host is "http://localhost:&lt;web server port&gt;"
</p>

<p>
The implementation has only been tested with services generated by
exporting OSGi service via Axis 1, and is not complete in terms of all
possible data types. The primitive types and arrays, are however
supported, both as input arguments and as results.

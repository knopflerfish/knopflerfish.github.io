    Build system fix. API versions of several bundles updated.<br>
    A fix has been made in the KF build system for issue 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3402741&group_id=82798&atid=567241">
      3402741 </a> 
    by adding implicit imports to the API version of the bundle of all
    packages exported  by the same bundle. The implicit import
    will get a version range starting with the exported version up to
    the next major version (excluded). This default setting is per
    recommendation of the OSGi Specification. 
    <p>
      This fix affects primarily the API version of certain bundles which exports multiple
      packages, and previously did not explicitly import their own exported packages. 
      The bundles listed below are all such API bundles. They have been
      updated to a new bug fix version (x.x.N) and are now corrected to
      have an implicit import of their respective exported
      packages. 
      <ul class="kf">

	<li>Deployment Admin (API) 1.0.2</li>

	<li>IO (API) 3.0.1 </li>
	<li>Log Service 3.0.6 </li>
	<li>User Admin 3.0.2</li>
	<li>Desktop 3.1.7</li>
	<li>JSDK 2.5.0.kf3-2</li>
	<li>Serial Port Device 2.0.1</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      API bundles with a single exported package are also affected and
      will get the same  implicit import. However the bundle version of these bundles
      have not been updated since this change has no real impact on
      such bundles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "_all" bundles are also affected such that they get the same
      version range on implicit imports. Previously they would get an
      implicit import with exactly the same version as the export. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The implementation versions of the bundles are not affected by
      this change.
